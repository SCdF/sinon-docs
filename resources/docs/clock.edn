{:title "Fake timers"
 :introduction "Fake timers is a synchronous implementation of `setTimeout` and friends that
Sinon.JS can overwrite the global functions with to allow you to more easily
test code using them. Fake timers provide a `clock` object to pass time, which
can also be used to control `Date` objects created through either `new Date();`
or `Date.now();` (if supported by the browser).

When faking timers with IE you also need
[sinon-ie-${current-version}](/releases/sinon-ie-${current-version}.js), which
should be loaded after sinon-${current-version}.js.

For standalone usage of fake timers it is recommended to use
[lolex](https://github.com/sinonjs/lolex) package instead. It provides the same
set features and was previously extracted from Sinon.JS.

<pre class=\"code-snippet timers\" data-lang=\"javascript\"><code>{
    setUp: function () {
        this.clock = sinon.useFakeTimers();
    },

    tearDown: function () {
        this.clock.restore();
    },

    \"test should animate element over 500ms\" : function(){
        var el = jQuery(\"&lt;div>&lt;/div>\");
        el.appendTo(document.body);

        el.animate({ height: \"200px\", width: \"200px\" });
        this.clock.tick(510);

        assertEquals(\"200px\", el.css(\"height\"));
        assertEquals(\"200px\", el.css(\"width\"));
    }
}</code></pre>"
